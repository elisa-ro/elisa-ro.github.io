Due to many factors, Mexico City has been known to have bad air quality. This consists of a variety of patterns but I wanted to understand if this perception is accurate and if there are any annual patterns or seasonal patterns that can be outlined.

From Mexico City's Air Quality Database () one can see how the levels in Mexico City have been decreasig over the years, but they're still higher than the recommended WHO's daily limit of PM10:

<script type="module">
import {Runtime, Inspector} from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@4/dist/runtime.js";
import define from "https://api.observablehq.com/@elisa-ro/air-quality-monitoring.js?v=3";
new Runtime().module(define, name => {
  if (name === "overallPlot") return new Inspector(document.querySelector("#observablehq-overallPlot-54eb5978"));
});
</script>

A perhaps better way of visualising the dates and the over 20 stations that are measuring the air quality is to see which days in which stations go above the recommended limit by the WHO:

new Runtime().module(define, name => {
  if (name === "overlimit") return new Inspector(document.querySelector("#observablehq-overlimit-58fc5e72"));
});
</script>


There seems to be many stations that have data that is not accounted for, so using the following facet visualisation we can get a better understanding of this:

new Runtime().module(define, name => {
  if (name === "myplot") return new Inspector(document.querySelector("#observablehq-myplot-65810ff9"));
});

The air quality center "TLA" seems to be the most consistent over the years, and it's also centrally located so there should be interesting trends to figure out. Over the years there seems to be downard trend:

//But now let's see what the data is like per average month in a year:
